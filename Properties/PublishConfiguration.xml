Brush Size Unlimiter raises the maximum size that brushes can be set to in the tool menu and in the developer mode panel.

Works ingame and in the editor. The mod on default sets the maximum brush size to 10000.

# Settings

In the mod settings, the maximum brush size can be configured from a low of 1000 to a high of 20000.

Set the maximum brush size to what your computer can handle, as the larger the brush size, the more performance degrades. The maximum brush size of 20000 covers the entire unlockable play area!

For brush sizes greater >2500, the mod temporarily sets the brush strength in the background to 0 while hovering to significantly increase performance, can optionally be disabled

# Notes

- When using extremely large brush sizes avoid placing trees or objects at full strength, if the brush is too big your game might crash
- If the brush touches over the edge of your city's purchased area, none of the brush actions will apply, use the Anarchy mod by yenyang to overcome this.
